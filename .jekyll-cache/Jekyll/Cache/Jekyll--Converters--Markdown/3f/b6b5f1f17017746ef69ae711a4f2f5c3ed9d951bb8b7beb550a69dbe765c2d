I"q<p>My name is Amy Tai and I am currently studying 
<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/management-sciences/management-engineering" target="_blank">Management Engineering</a> at the University of Waterloo.</p>

<p>Within the university, I volunteer with various organizations to promote Women in Engineering such as the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/women-in-engineering/volunteer-opportunities">WiE Outreach Squad</a> and <a href="http://www.onwie.ca/amy-tai/">ONWiE</a>. In the past, I held an Undergraduate Research Assistantship (URA) in the topic of Data Security and Applied Cryptography and assisted in the publication of an [Energy Consumption Research Paper] (http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/) (Select Technical Reports #3). I also co-ran the [University of Waterloo Entrepreneurship Society] (https://entsoc.ca/) in Spring 2019.</p>

<p>I spend my spare time swimming, going on adventures with my friends and reading books.</p>

<p>I love to meet new people through volunteer events, coffee chats, and participating in new activities.</p>
